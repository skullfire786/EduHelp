# EduHelp – A Peer-to-Peer Academic Support Platform

EduHelp is a personal initiative to solve two common student challenges:
1. Catching up after missing academic classes or falling behind.
2. Earning flexible income by helping peers with notes and assignments.

## 🔍 Problem

Many students struggle with academic backlog but don’t have a reliable, fast way to get notes or support. At the same time, others are willing to help but lack a platform to monetize their academic strengths.

## 💡 Solution

EduHelp is a platform (concept stage) where:
- Students can request academic help (notes, explanations, assignments).
- Other students can offer support and earn money.
- Trust is built through peer reviews and ratings.

## 🧩 Key Features

- On-demand help requests for notes and academic support
- Peer review system for reliability
- Flexible work for student helpers

## 🔬 MVP Plan

- Start with a WhatsApp group or Google Form to match seekers and helpers
- Track usage and feedback
- Plan a future mobile/web app with scheduling, chat, and AI features (plagiarism detection, note summarization)
